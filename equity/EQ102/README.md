EQ102 Market Cap Indexes - Index Valuation
-------------------------

### Background

The Price-to-Earnings ratio (PE ratio) helps us to tell whether a stock is over-
or under-valued. Similarly, we can use the PE ratio to test whether the index is
over- or under-valued. (When the index is large enough, it also hints whether
the equity market is properly valued.)

Think of the `TOP500 index` (EQ101) as a company, the market capitalization
(earnings) of this `TOP500 company` is the sum of all its constituents' market
cap (earnings). Then the index's PE ratio is simply the ratio of the index
market cap and the index earnings.

### Problem Description

Calculate the index PE for the `TOP500 Index` over at least the past 5 years.

### Bonus Questions

Can you duplicate Robert Shiller's Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE)?
